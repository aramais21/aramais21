## 👋 About Me
I’m a backend-focused JavaScript/TypeScript engineer with **4+ years of experience** building and maintaining production-ready systems across multiple industries. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and designing reliable backend services that scale with growing user and data needs.

I’ve worked in fast-paced environments, collaborated closely with product and business teams, and taken ownership of features end-to-end — from design and implementation to deployment and monitoring.
